The tool 
We used Justinmind Prototyper.

Operating instructions
Download the folder, and click on index.html, and follow the onscreen instructions.

Limitations
We only create pages that are enough to demonstrate the 3 essential tasks, some pages are left out, such as the help page, the browse page, the create an event page. Moreover, the 3 tasks are all from a volunteer’s perspective, however our website should have slightly different layout for event organizers. These additional pages will probably be included in the high-fidelity prototype.We hand-coded some details, and not all parts that suppose to redirect to other pages have all the links yet, we only implemented enough pages to demonstrate the 3 essential tasks. We only showcased the two of us as users, and most of the time, we only showed Joanna as the user, to demonstrate how a user would use it. We hand-coded the home page, the event page, the search results, and profile details. They are required because we don’t have a database that stores all the information about an event, its images, videos, or social feeds, so we have to hand code the details of an event. Our users are limited to the two team members, and the profile details are all created around Joanna as the user. This is required because we don’t have real users yet, and we don’t have a database to store all user information. However the hand-coded features are essential and enough to demonstrate the functionalities of our prototype.
